I'm currently an assistant professor at [Computer Science Department](http://www.cs.ecnu.edu.cn), [East China Normal University](http://www.ecnu.edu.cn). Before joining ECNU, I got both my B.S. (2007) and Ph.D (2012) degree from [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn), and worked as a research fellow at [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg) (2013).

##Research
My research interests are mainly on natural language processing and machine learning (structured prediction, online learning). I aim to build efficient and effective models for computing human languages.
